### Recent Changes
- ✅ **Testing Suite Complete**: All unit tests (schema, PII, DOCX, fallback), integration tests (e2e, error handling), and provider tests passing
- ✅ **PII Redaction**: Configurable redaction of emails, phone numbers, SSNs in logs and error messages
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Migration**: Replaced in-memory storage with persistent PostgreSQL database (facts, drafts, templates)
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: In-process rate limiting per API token with standard HTTP headers
- ✅ **OpenAI Integration**: Switched from GPT-5 to GPT-4o for faster response times (15s vs 83s)
- Added Bearer auth for /v1/* and multipart attachments + timestamps for intake
- Implemented correlation ID logging (x-request-id) with duration in server logs
- Added Bedrock retry with exponential backoff and prompt-level guardrails
- Added in-process metrics: per-route request duration (avg) and token usage tracking
- Implemented draft versioning (v1/v2) with automatic change logs and version history API
- Added draft restore functionality (POST /v1/restore/:facts_id) to create new drafts from previous versions
- Added template management API (GET/POST /v1/templates) with database-backed storage
- Enhanced generate responses with explanations for why major legal sections were included
- Added critic pass: AI reviews drafts for factual accuracy and identifies unsupported claims
- Added LLM provider abstraction: Support for both OpenAI and AWS Bedrock with simple env flag switch
- Added PDF/DOCX file upload to /v1/intake with automatic text extraction using pdf-parse and mammoth
- Implemented intelligent text merging: Extract incident details and damage amounts from uploaded documents

## Overview

Steno is an AI-powered legal document generator that helps attorneys and paralegals create professional demand letters quickly and accurately. The system ingests case facts and generates structured legal documents using either OpenAI GPT models or AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet), with export to Word format for final editing.

### Core Flow
1. **Intake**: Attorney/paralegal provides case facts (parties, incident, damages, venue)
2. **Generate**: AI produces a structured demand letter draft with all required legal sections
3. **Edit & Export**: Review, edit, and export to DOCX format

### Key Differentiators
- **Fact-based only**: No hallucinations - all assertions must be supported by provided facts
- **Structured output**: Consistent legal document format with all mandatory sections
- **Professional grade**: DOCX export with proper formatting for court filing
- **Fast iteration**: <5s p95 generation time for typical 2-page letter

## API Specification

- State Management: Zustand or React Context
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- API Client: Axios or native fetch with custom wrapper

**Key Libraries:**
- Markdown: `react-markdown` + `react-markdown-editor-lite`
- File Upload: `react-dropzone`
- Google APIs: `@react-oauth/google` + `gapi-script`
- Notifications: `react-hot-toast` or `sonner`
- Routing: Next.js routing or `react-router-dom`
- Date Formatting: `date-fns`
- Icons: `lucide-react` or `react-icons`

### Demo Day Checklist (Minimum Viable Demo)

**Must Have for Demo:**
- [x] Backend API running and tested
- [ ] Landing page with clear value proposition
- [ ] Intake form with file upload (PDF/DOCX)
- [ ] Generate button that shows loading state
- [ ] Draft preview with markdown rendering
- [ ] Export to Google Docs button (working OAuth flow)
- [ ] Success modal showing Google Docs link
- [ ] Basic styling (professional, clean)

**Demo Script:**
1. **Intro:** "This is Steno's Demand Letter Generator"
2. **Upload:** "I'll upload this accident report PDF..."
3. **Fill Facts:** "Enter plaintiff, defendant, and damages..."
4. **Generate:** "Click generate... AI drafts the letter in ~15 seconds"
5. **Review:** "Here's the draft with all legal sections..."
6. **Export:** "Now I'll export to Google Docs for collaboration..."
7. **Collaborate:** "I can now invite colleagues, add comments, track changes..."

### Priority Order for Development

1. **Day 1:** Project setup, API client, intake form, file upload
2. **Day 2:** Generate draft, markdown preview, basic styling
3. **Day 3:** Google OAuth, export to Google Docs, success flow
4. **Day 4:** Templates, draft history, UI polish
5. **Day 5:** Testing, deployment, demo rehearsal

### Notes
- Focus on **demo-ready** features first (P0)
- Keep UI simple and professional
- Google Docs export is the "wow" factor for demo
- Test OAuth flow thoroughly (it can be finicky)
- Have DOCX export as backup if Google Docs fails during demo
