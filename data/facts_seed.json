    "incident": "On January 15, 2024, I noticed unauthorized charges totaling $2,450 on my credit card statement. I immediately contacted ACME Bank to dispute these charges and requested a provisional credit. Despite multiple calls and submitting all required documentation including police report and affidavits, the bank has failed to issue the credit within the required timeframe. The unauthorized charges have caused my account to go overlimit, resulting in additional fees of $350. I have been a customer for 15 years and never had any issues until now.",

    "incident": "I took out a personal loan with QuickLoan Finance in March 2023 for $5,000 at an agreed APR of 12%. However, upon reviewing my payment history, I discovered that the company has been charging me an effective APR of 28% through hidden fees and charges not disclosed in the original loan documents. Despite making regular payments totaling $6,200 over 18 months, my principal balance has only decreased by $800. When I contacted customer service, they were unable to provide a clear explanation of the fee structure.",

    "incident": "I rented an apartment from MegaCorp Property Management from January 2023 to December 2023. Upon moving out, I left the apartment in excellent condition, having professionally cleaned it and repaired all minor wear and tear. I provided proper 60-day notice as required by the lease. Despite this, MegaCorp has refused to return my security deposit of $2,500, citing bogus damages including 'carpet replacement' for carpets that were already 10 years old when I moved in. They also charged me $800 for 'repainting' when the lease clearly states normal wall wear is expected. I have photographs documenting the pristine condition of the apartment at move-out.",
